# DS_ALGO_BOOTCAMP
Comman fear to a software engineer is DS and Algo. I have seen many good programer lack this skill and they become **programming langauge oriented programmer** which is not bad but most of the good paying company hire a person who have good knowledge of __DS & Algo__. This is my attempt to make a easier and complete guide to master DS Algo.

# How To Use This Guide
